# 📱 Phone Addiction Predictor

This is a simple interactive web app built with **Streamlit** and **scikit-learn** that predicts whether a user is likely to be addicted to their phone based on usage patterns.

### 🔍 How It Works
The app takes in:
- **Screen Time** (in hours)
- **Unlock Count** (how many times the phone is unlocked per day)
- **Notification Response Time** (in seconds)

It uses a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on sample data to predict whether the user is **Addicted** or **Not Addicted**, and then provides personalized recommendations.
